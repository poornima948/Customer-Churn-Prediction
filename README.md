# Customer-Churn-Prediction
Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project implements a supervised machine learning model to predict
customer churn using historical customer data. The objective is to identify
customers who are likely to leave the service and help businesses take
proactive retention actions.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Machine Learning

## Project Workflow
- Data loading and exploration
- Data preprocessing and categorical encoding
- Feature engineering
- Model training using Logistic Regression and Random Forest
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix
- Feature importance analysis to identify key churn drivers

## Results
The Random Forest model achieved better performance compared to baseline models.
Key factors such as contract type, tenure, and payment method were identified as
important contributors to customer churn.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning workflow for customer
churn prediction and highlights how predictive models can support business
decision-making and customer retention strategies.
